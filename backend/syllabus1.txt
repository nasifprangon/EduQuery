COURSE DESCRIPTION
This course focuses on privacy and confidentiality and current legislative and health policy issues for electronic health record systems (EHRs). Ethical issues related to EHRs, and advocacy of patients' and consumers' needs are explored. The course provides students with an understanding of regulatory requirements related to the protection of health information and introduces technical approaches to ensure compliance.
COURSE FORMAT/INSTRUCTIONAL METHODS
Format: Asynchronous online

This course takes an active learning approach and asks that you play a key role in actively engaging in the course content and communicating with the instructor and peers during the learning process. Discussions and in-class activities are used to involve students in the conversation better. Engagement and participation are built into the course by design. The goal is to deepen knowledge about specific course topics while keeping your interest. Activities are never meant as busy work. I desire that you find value in all our assignments.  
COURSE EXPECTATIONS FOR STUDENT SUCCESS
I am here to support your learning goals in the class, and I want to see everyone succeed. I encourage you to use all available resources, including advisors, the Writing Center, and Library Resources, to assist you with the course. On average, over the semester, this course will require approximately 10 hours of your time per week. Please plan to spend approximately 5 hours each week reading materials, completing assignments, and watching assigned videos. This time may need to be adjusted depending on how fast or slowly you read. These are all approximations.

These expectations are based on the premise that 1) This course is a 3-credit course and 2) Temple's policy on credit hours states that 1 semester credit is equivalent to 1 hour (50 minutes) of faculty instruction time per week (inclusive of exam week) AND a minimum of 2 hours of out-of-class student work.
STATEMENT ON DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION
The College of Public Health supports and encourages diversity and inclusion. I am committed to the principle of universal learning, which means I will do all I can to make our classrooms, virtual meetings, and interactions as inclusive as possible. To support universal learning, I will promote an environment of mutual respect, civility in our interactions, and the ability to listen and observe others– I expect that all participants in the class will work towards the same goal. 
You have the right to be addressed by your preferred name and personal pronouns. Sharing your preferred pronouns publicly is one way we can all honor each other's preferences. I will address you as you wish to be addressed. 

You have the right to full access to all course materials and you are welcome to translate the course materials (for example, you are welcome to usehttps://translate.google.com/?sl=auto&tl=en&op=docs).

COURSE OBJECTIVES AND COMPETENCIES 


REQUIRED COURSE ASSIGNMENTS
Students should plan to submit all deliverables on time to avoid falling behind.  This course is offered in a 6-week format. To help ease some of the burden, students choose which assignments to complete for credit. I refer to these as "choice activities." All assessments are assigned on the date indicated on the course schedule.  Students are expected to follow the posted instructions. Late assignments will receive a 10% deduction for each day late, beginning immediately after the due date. 

Total Points Achieved
Total Possible Points 
											           = Final Grade

Students should expect feedback (and grades posted) within 7 weekdays of the due date. 

Below are brief descriptions of the deliverables for HIM 5127. Please see Canvas for more detailed information on each assignment. Refer to the Appendix for the Ransomware Case Study.

Library Workshops: The library workshops were created by a CPH liaison from the Charles Library. Library workshops provide you with an opportunity to learn how to be both successful and efficient in your search for relevant content for the Ransomware Case Study. The workshop is not graded. Therefore, students who are well-versed in research practice can skip it.

Discussion Board: Discussions are used in this course to engage in conversations with classmates and the instructor about various concepts explored in the class. Engaging in these discussions will increase your retention of the course material and help you to be able to analyze, critique & apply terms, concepts, and theories in our field. Be prepared to participate in these discussions by preparing your thoughts and comments for a peer on their posts.  You are expected to write professionally and remember that this is a safe space to express yourself (a judgment-free zone). The goal is for engagement and further synthesis of the course material. Let us avoid posting to get a checkmark. That approach quickly turns our discussion board into a Discussion BORED.

Case Studies and Activities: These activities gauge your learning of key course concepts. These are short writing assignments submitted via Canvas.  You are expected to write in a professional tone and check your paper for consistency, coherence, spelling, and grammar. 

Ransomware Case Study (course-long project): The Ransomware Case Study is a course-long project broken into three deliverables (annotated bibliography, case findings, and reflective questions). The purpose of this case study is to analyze the intricacies of ransomware attacks, including their methods of infiltration, transmission, and impact on affected systems. By meticulously examining a recent security incident, this assignment aims to expose the vulnerabilities exploited by ransomware, the strategies employed by bad actors, and the consequential damages incurred by targeted entities. By dissecting this case study, valuable insights can be gleaned to enhance cybersecurity practices, fortify defense mechanisms, and mitigate the potential devastation wrought by future ransomware attacks.



GRADING SCALE

Each assignment will receive a numerical grade and be weighted in the calculation of a final numerical grade as indicated above.  Final grades may be rounded up based on continued professionalism and engagement. For example, if your final course grade is 92.5, it could be rounded up to a 93 (A) based on continuous professionalism throughout the course. If your final course grade is 92.4, it will remain a 92 (A-).
ATTENDANCE PROTOCOLS AND YOUR HEALTH
HIM 5127 does not have any required class meeting days or times. Therefore, you do not have to log in or meet at a specified time or location. It is your right to observe religious holidays without negative consequences within the course. Please reach out to discuss with your instructor at the start of the semester so that deadlines can be reviewed in advance of the religious observation. You will still be held responsible for course content and any assignments, but you will not lose points. Participation is not graded but will substantially enhance your comprehension of the material and help prepare you for the assignments & graded assessments. Participation also shows professionalism and gives the faculty something to base future recommendations on.  
Course MINIMUM GRADE
The College of Public Health requires that all graduate students achieve a minimum grade of "B" for all courses which are considered required for their major. Please check the graduate bulletin (https://bulletin.temple.edu/graduate/) to confirm if this class is a major requirement for your program. For further questions, please see your academic advisor.
